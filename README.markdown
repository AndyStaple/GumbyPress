GumbyPress
====

What is it?
---
GumbyPress is a WordPress Theme built based on the Gumby Framework. The WordPress Theme is in its very early stages and not yet ready for live sites. I'm building it as a base theme for future projects, as well as for something to anyone else to download and use for their WordPress sites. I'll be keeping this updated as the Gumby folks update their framework, and all Gumby Files are kept separate for easy updates!
